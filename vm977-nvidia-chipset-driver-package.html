Hey, I've been a Linux user for 7 years, and have really enjoyed it (presently on Fedora 24). I'm interested in other Unix-like open-source OSes, and TrueOS looks like a great distribution of FreeBSD. I have a few questions before I try the switch: 1. What's the frequency of base-system updates for TrueOS? 2. I've noticed that TrueOS ships `drm-next` equivalent to Linux 4.7/4.8. That implies that if my graphics hardware works perfectly with Fedora 24 (Linux 4.8.4), I should have no problems.
